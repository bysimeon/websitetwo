## this project started with a falling out of love with cooking. during most of summer and fall '19 i struggles with binge easting and started to slwoly cooking became strongly linked to many negative emotions and thoughts. so, i decided to make something that could bring some fun back into cooking.

## now **whatiate** exists as a both a catalogue of my recipes, a motivator for healthy eating and a concept for repurposing youtube content. 

## this is another of my **works in progress**, so any suggetions or contributions are always welcome.

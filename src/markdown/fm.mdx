started off as a widget on my old website, that showed visitors what music i was listening to live. over time, it evolved into it's own page, where various data from my last.fm account was visualized. now, it's living on a new subdomain, and allows any last.fm user to view data on thier account.

this is still work in progess, so any suggetions or contributions are always welcome.
